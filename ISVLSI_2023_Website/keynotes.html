Jack Kilby invented the first integrated circuit 65 years ago, following the invention of a transistor about a decade prior. Today the chip technology is recognized as the most critical technology in the world. During the last half century, the semiconductor chip industry has made phenomenal progresses to benefit our daily life. To mention some, 5G mobile communication from anywhere to everywhere, virtual meetings and remote learning under the pandemic, autonomous cars, energy-efficient lighting, and AI applications as in ChatGPT and health care. An average-car of today contains 1200 chips. Shortage of less-than-a-dollar chips forced the manufacturing line of high-price cars to stop and be idle. Fifty years ago, the most advanced Intel microprocessor chip used a few thousand transistors. At present, the most advanced wafer-scale AI chip contains more than two trillion transistors. This phenomenal advancement, riding on the wave of Moore’s Law and Beyond, owes a great deal to innovations in materials, devices, circuits and systems, EDA technology, manufacturing, and packaging. In this talk, we will highlight and discuss benchmarking innovations in CMOS and heterogeneous VLSI circuits, systems, and applications. In view of manufacturability, energy efficiency and reliability of VLSI system chips, the  figure-of-merit of VLSI chips can be pitched as “the smaller, the cooler, the better.” Emergent technologies, including memristor technology, will be discussed along with their applications for ultra-dense low-power intelligent VLSI systems, future neuromorphic computing, and generative AI and scientific hardware acceleration.</p> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Sung-Mo Steve Kang is a Distinguished Chair Professor Emeritus and Distinguished Research Professor at the Baskin School of Engineering, UC Santa Cruz.

One of the main reasons is the physical limit of silicon transistors' miniaturization. No prominent successor technology to the current CMOS logic exists, but some possible alternatives have been investigated. In this talk, we will discuss the historical evolution of computer machines until the end of the golden era, when designers could develop software, architecture, implementation, and devices independently. So, a question comes to mind: What will we have in the future? Do we need to continue controlling the electric current to perform computation? Are there other alternatives? A wide variety of new nanotechnologies will generate many possibilities for developing new computational applications at low energy, high speed, and high resilience. Let's see some of these possible alternatives.</p> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Omar Paranaiba Vilela Neto received his undergrad degree in Computer Engineering (2003), M.Sc. degree (2006), and Ph.D. degree (2009) in Electrical Engineering from PUC-Rio, Brazil.

Here, on one side increasing monolythic integration of cooperating computational and physical sensor components is necessary, e. g. in embedded and smart on-demand automatized environments as diverse as applied in space, avionics, automotive, chemical processes, civil infrastructure, energy, healthcare, manufacturing (Industry 4.0), transportation, entertainment, and communication/consumer appliances. Moreover, future complex dynamically adaptive and multi-domain electronic system integration tends to be more and more dependent on distributed real-time and embedded HPC availability. This results in the strong demand of newly operating decentralized/centralized intelligent, interconnected, and silicon technology integrated solutions, subject to increased performance needs to facilitate computationally intensive algorithms, power consumption to be minimized, as well as sufficient degrees of reliability and verifiability to employ digital systems in safety-critical environments, e. g. especially also in future automotive system integration. Existing technology must evolve in order to meet such scalable and high requirements, whereas open source hardware and AI could also play key roles in this process. Multipurpose adaptivity, connectivity and reliability are crucial, especially in scaling down silicon technologies according to Moore for future processor technologies incl. dynamically reconfigurable and AI accelerators. This requires in addition new approaches for parallel programming, reference technology platforms (RTP) and standardized tool flows. The talk will discuss challenges of high-end heterogenous multi-core/accelerator HPC platforms incl. their reliable SoC and SiP hardware/software integration, e. g. towards smart, scalable & embedded Automotive Supercomputing solutions.

In the case of mobile electronics, we can see this paradox at work, as the gains from Moore's law scaling are almost exclusively reinvested into additional features rather than energy savings. For instance, modern smartphones contain SoCs with 20 times more transistors than a decade ago. Currently the phone in our pocket may contain almost as many transistors as there are grains of sand on earth (!). But the power consumption has remained flat while improvements in functionality have been relatively modest. Another recent example can be seen in the significant energy required to power machine learning hardware, the increase of which far outstrips the rate of regular compute efficiency. Jevons paradox also applies to adjacent domains. While automotive propulsion has become more efficient, the gains are largely negated by the fact that cars have been growing into tall SUVs with oversized wheels that serve only aesthetic purposes. In this keynote presentation, we will discuss the scale of this paradox in microelectronics and in electrical systems more generally.</p> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Patrick Groeneveld currently focuses on machine learning hardware synthesis.

North Carolina State University, USA</span></h3><h4> Chiplets for AI – AI for chiplets</h4> <p><b>Abstract:</b><br>Modern machine learning workloads are increasing in scale at a rapid rate. For example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, requiring 570 GB of storage, and benefits from having high-bandwidth interfaces between the logic and the storage. We describe a chiplet based solution and a 3D logic on memory based solution to this problem.  The chiplet based solution relies on a scalable RISC-V core and accelerator pair, one accelerator for sparse CNN layers, and another for MLP and LSTM acceleration. The chiplet set was recently demonstrated in 55 nm CMOS. The 3D logic on memory solution leverages high density hybrid bonding and TSVs, together with the SIMD processor array and was designed to handle a wide variety of machine learning workloads. This solution can handle peak bandwidths of 130 Tbps and outperforms all other solutions in area efficiency, and all other programmable solutions in power efficiency. It is currently being redesigned for emerging workloads and arrange a memory solution. Hybrid bonding also enables radical improvements in PPA for two chip stacks and enables design obfuscation of design intent. Recent experiments demonstrating these solutions will be discussed. Chiplet based design comes with a lot of complexity, in that there are a lot of factors to consider while trying to determine an optimal design set. We have been exploring generative ML methods to drive chiplet early design and will discuss some results to date.  Generative ML has potential to excel at multifactor optimization and to manage complex design steps.  One challenge in generative ML is how to achieve potential with reasonable training time.  Potential solutions to this problem will be discussed.</p> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Paul D.

It has been shown that ionizing particles can cause faults in microelectronics that inhibit operation and hence reduce reliability. Consequently, fault tolerant schemes have been developed to sustain system functionality at its required level. When implementing fault tolerance, additional hardware (logic) is needed.  The increase in hardware can have a significant impact on a system’s size, weight, and power (SWAP); and can compromise system integration.   To reduce SWAP, fault tolerance is strategically inserted into portions of a system, deemed to be the most critical. As a result, residual risk exists, and requires probabilistic error rates to be calculated.   In this talk, types of ionization and their effects on microelectronics (terrestrially and in space) will be explained.  Methods of fault tolerance assurance, from testing to probabilistic fault prediction, will be discussed as they pertain to safety-critical applications in the automotive and space industries.</p> <p><b>Short Bio:</b><br>Mrs. Melanie Berg has over 30-years of experience as a designer, verification engineer, instructor, and reviewer for ASIC and FPGA applications.
