				Abstract</b>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
				For decades, digital design has remained largely unchanged. While digital hardware performance has marched along at a relentless pace of improvement, the design process itself has been relatively constant. Digital synthesis, from the late 1980’s, is arguably the most recent EDA innovation that was truly impactful. In the face of escalating performance, connectivity, and security expectations, it is now time for EDA methodologies and tools to step up and play a more inventive role. This is especially critical as Moore’s Law runs out of gas. In this keynote, DARPA PM Serge Leef will outline a new call-to-innovation in four major areas: IP generators, hardware/software co-development, functional verification, and full-system optimization.

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>

				</p>

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Mr. Serge Leef joined DARPA in August 2018 as a program manager in the Microsystems Technology Office (MTO). His research interests include computer architecture, chip design tools, simulation, synthesis, semiconductor intellectual property (IP), cyber-physical modeling, distributed systems, secure design flows, and supply chain management. He is also interested in the facilitation of startup ecosystems and business aspects of technology.<br> <br>
				Leef came to DARPA from Mentor, now Siemens EDA, where from 2010 until 2018 he was a Vice President of New Ventures, responsible for identifying and developing technology and business opportunities in systems-oriented markets. Additionally, from 1999 to 2018, he served as a division General Manager, responsible for defining strategies and building successful businesses around design automation products in the areas of hardware/software co-design, multi-physics simulation, IP integration, SoC optimization, design data management, automotive/aerospace networking, cloud-based electronic design, Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, and hardware cybersecurity.<br> <br>
				Prior to joining Mentor, he was responsible for design automation at Silicon Graphics, where he and his team created revolutionary, high-speed simulation tools to enable the design of high-speed 3D graphics chips, which defined the state-of-the-art in visualization, imaging, gaming, and special effects for a decade. Prior to that, he managed a CAE/CAD organization at Microchip and developed functional and physical design and verification tools for major 8- and 16-bit microcontroller and microprocessor programs at Intel.<br> <br>
				Leef received his Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering and Master of Science degree in computer science from Arizona State University. He has served on corporate, state, and academic advisory boards, delivered numerous public speeches, and holds patents in hardware Trojan detection and Internet of Things (loT) infrastructure.

				Abstract</b>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
				Climate change is considered the biggest threat and challenge currently facing humanity. The scientific community have established that failing to keep the global temperature from rising above the upper limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius will have dire consequences, including world hunger, degraded health, and political instability. Attention is increasing on the role that technology plays in relationship with climate change. Some are concerned about the energy consumption toll of technology, and in particular energy-devouring workloads such as AI. Others see opportunity in leveraging technology, including AI, to combat climate change. <br> <br>

				In my talk I will address the two sides of the coin. I posit that technology can play an absolute crucial role in accelerating the scientific discovery of new material, e.g., for carbon capture, in improvements of our resiliency and preparedness to climate change, and much more. At the same time, I posit that as technologists we have responsibility to improve the efficiency of system, software, and management software. New trends, such as the commercialization of renewable energy, and system innovation such as specialized hardware open the door for new research opportunities. Cloud computing in particular ought to be scrutinized closely. Cloud computing promise efficiency gains, however, third party clouds, despite the PR noise, are yet to adopt openness and clear methodology to enable meaningful quantification of the actual carbon footprint cost, and potential savings.

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
				As quantum computing devices continues to scale up, we would like to access the quality of the existing quantum compilation (or design automation) tools. As the first step, we focus on the layout synthesis step.  We develop a novel method to construct a family of quantum circuits with known optimal, QUEKO, which have known optimal depths and gate counts on a given quantum device coupling graph. With QUEKO, we evaluated several leading industry and academic LSQC tools, including Cirq from Google,  Qiskit from IBM, and t|ket> from CQC. We found rather surprisingly large optimality gaps, up to 45x on even near-term feasible circuits. Then, we went on to develop a tool for optimal layout synthesis for quantum computing, named OLSQ, which formulates LSQC as a mathematical optimization problem. OLSQ more compactly represents the solution space than previous optimal solutions and achieved exponential reduction in computational complexity.  Further enhancements to OLSQ can be made for domain-specific quantum applications.  We shall highlight two such applications: quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and chemical simulation.  (Joint work with Bochen Daniel Tan)

				Abstract</b>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
				The rise of machine learning has already transformed many research areas, and has the potential to transform chip design. While ML has inspired the design of new domain-specific accelerators, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), there exists many opportunities for using ML to target traditional areas of chip design across the entire stack. In this talk, I will discuss how to identify whether ML can be applied for a particular problem, and what strategies might be suitable for building a practical and robust ML-based solution. I will cover several research projects from the ML for Systems team in Google Brain, including our work on using deep reinforcement learning to drive state-of-the-art results in chip floorplanning, and our latest effort in using ML to automatically optimize key ML accelerator design decisions within the hardware-software stack.
