In the past decade this has inspired new self-aware strategies for emerging computing substrates (e.g., complex heterogeneous MPSoCs) that must cope with the (often conflicting) challenges of resiliency, energy, heat, cost, performance, security, etc. in the face of highly dynamic operational behaviors and environmental conditions. Earlier we had championed the concept of <b>CyberPhysical-Systems-on-Chip (CPSoC)</b>, a new class of sensor-actuator rich many-core computing platforms that intrinsically couples on-chip and cross-layer sensing and actuation to enable self-awareness. Unlike traditional MPSoCs, CPSoC is distinguished by an intelligent co-design of the control, communication, and computing (C3) system that interacts with the physical environment in real-time in order to modify the system’s behavior so as to adaptively achieve desired objectives and Quality-of-Service (QoS). The CPSoC design paradigm enables self-awareness (i.e., the ability of the system to observe its own internal and external behaviors such that it is capable of making judicious decision) and (opportunistic) adaptation using the concept of cross-layer physical and virtual sensing and actuations applied across different layers of the hardware/software system stack. The closed loop control used for adaptation to dynamic variation -- commonly known as the observe-decide-act (ODA) loop -- is implemented using an adaptive, reflective middleware layer.<br><br>In this talk I will present a case study of this adaptive, reflective middleware layer using a holistic approach for performing resource allocation decisions and power management by leveraging concepts from reflective software. Reflection enables dynamic adaptation based on both external feedback and introspection (i.e., self-assessment). In our context, this translates into performing resource management actuation considering both sensing information (e.g., readings from performance counters, power sensors, etc.) to assess the current system state, as well as models to predict the behavior of other system components before performing an action. I will summarize results leveraging our adaptive-reflective middleware toolchain to i) perform energy-efficient task mapping on heterogeneous architectures, ii) explore the design space of novel HMP architectures, and iii) extend the lifetime of mobile devices.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card-footer"> <p class="text-justify"><b>Biography: </b>Nikil Dutt is a Chancellor's Professor of CS, Cognitive Sciences, and EECS at the University of California, Irvine.

With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) regime that promises exciting new applications from smart cities to connected autonomous vehicles, security has come to the forefront of the system design process. Recent discoveries and reports on numerous security attacks on microchips and circuits violate the well-regarded concept of hardware trust anchors. It has prompted system designers to develop wide array of design-for-security and test/validation solutions to achieve high security assurance for electronic hardware, which supports the software stack. At the same time, emerging security issues and countermeasures have also led to interesting interplay between security, verification, and interoperability. Verification of hardware for security and trust at different levels of abstraction is rapidly becoming an integral part of the system design flow. The global economic trend that promotes outsourcing of design and fabrication process to untrusted facilities coupled with the prevalent practice of system on chip design using untrusted 3rd party intellectual property blocks (IPs), has given rise to the critical need of trust verification of IPs, system-on-chip design, and fabricated chips. The talk will also cover spectrum of security challenges for IoTs and describe emerging solutions in creating secure trustworthy hardware that can enable IoT security for the mass.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card-footer"> <p class="text-justify"><b>Biography: </b>Swarup Bhunia is a preeminence professor of cybersecurity and Steven Yatauro endowed faculty fellow of Computer Engineering at University of Florida, FL, USA.

System-level design is essential to deal with the enormous complexity of today’s advanced systems. At the same time, fast time to market is as essential as ever. And robustness and reliability are increasing in importance, as the focus of the semiconductor industry shifts to applications with high safety requirements such as automotive. High-level system models, known as Virtual Prototypes, are essential to meet all these challenges. Fault injection is the most common technique to evaluate system robustness.<br>I will outline some recent progress in Virtual Prototypes for safety evaluations. I will especially discuss how both high performance and high accuracy in fault injection can be achieved at the same time. Robustness evaluation has to be extended to Firmware in addition to Hardware. Future challenges for system design will conclude my presentation.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="card-footer"> <p class="text-justify"><b>Biography: </b>Ulf Schlichtmann holds a Dipl.-Ing. degree (MSc equivalent) and a doctorate in electrical engineering from TUM, as well as a technology business degree.
