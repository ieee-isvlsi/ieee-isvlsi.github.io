					Abstract</b>
					</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
						The effects of the pandemics on the high-tech industry have been profound. Some say that in 6 months we have experienced a 5 year acceleration in the digitalization of our life and work. Has it been too fast? The recent rout of the most visible high-tech companies in the stock market may be a demonstration of this phenomenon. On the other hand, the world has seen a severe shortage of semiconductors that may last longer than expected. The pandemic has caused disruption in the supply chains including the one that feeds the semiconductor industry. Is this shortage caused only by the supply chain problems or is it a sign of the increasing importance of this industry? We are witnessing a rush towards building fabs and governments worldwide are seeking measures to support the semiconductor industry. We are also experiencing a marked shortage of talent, even more so than in the software domain. We will debate these trends and outline what possible outcomes are in terms of education, research and industry health.

				Abstract</b>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
					Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms have demonstrated impressive results in a wide range of applications. However, they still have serious shortcomings for use cases that require real-time processing of sensory data and closed-loop interactions with the real-world, in uncontrolled environments.<br>
					Neuromorphic Intelligence (NI) aims to mitigate this shortcoming by developing ultra-low power electronic circuits and radically different brain-inspired in-memory computing architectures.<br>
					In this presentation I will present examples of NI circuits that exploit the physics of their devices to directly emulate the biophysics of real neurons, and I will demonstrate applications of NI processing systems to use cases that require low power, local processing of the sensed data, and that cannot afford to connect to the cloud for running AI algorithms.

				Abstract</b>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
					In the last decade, there have been major changes in the families of ferroelectric materials available for integration with CMOS electronics.  This talk will discuss the possibility of exploiting the 3rd dimension in microelectronics for functions beyond interconnect optimization, enabling 3D non-von Neumann computer architectures exploiting ferroelectrics for local memory, logic in memory, digital/analog computation, and neuromorphic/reconfigurable functionality. This approach circumvents the end of Moore's law in 2D scaling, while simultaneously overcoming the "von Neumann bottleneck" in moving instructions and data between separate logic and memory circuits. The talk will cover circuit and architectural features leveraging the non-volatile properties of ferro-electric FETs for hardware obfuscation, accelerator designs and in-memory compute structures.

				Abstract</b>
				</p>
				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
					In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, where we see many interconnected and heterogeneous mobile and fixed smart devices, distributing intelligence from the cloud to the edge has become critical for the sustainability of the infrastructures. A distributed approach also comes with additional benefits (e.g. power efficiency, low-latency inference, privacy-by-design) with respect to centralized cloud computing. TinyML is an emerging field that has gained much traction in the last few years. This paradigm brings novel challenges to the embedded systems domain, particularly when we aim to perform deep learning at the "very edge" on IoT end devices, where limited resources are available. In this presentation, I will propose some of the research done at E3DA to tackle the TinyML challenges for energy-efficient embedded devices. Our primary focus is on multimedia analytics at the edge and privacy-by-design systems. Our efforts landed in state-of-the-art audio and video analytics performance, namely in sound event detection and multi-object detection and tracking with a fraction of the computational complexity of the previous state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we developed a novel approach to generate deep fakes for privacy-by-design applications directly at the edge.

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
						Computing is bottlenecked by data. Large amounts of application data
overwhelm storage capability, communication capability, and
computation capability of the modern machines we design today. As a
result, many key applications' performance, efficiency and scalability
are bottlenecked by data movement. In this lecture, we describe three
major shortcomings of modern architectures in terms of 1) dealing with
data, 2) taking advantage of the vast amounts of data, and 3)
exploiting different semantic properties of application data. We argue
that an intelligent architecture should be designed to handle data
well. We show that handling data well requires designing architectures
based on three key principles: 1) data-centric, 2) data-driven, 3)
data-aware. We give several examples for how to exploit each of these
principles to design a much more efficient and high performance
computing system. We especially discuss recent research that aims to
fundamentally reduce memory latency and energy, and practically enable
computation close to data, with at least two promising novel
directions: 1) processing using memory, which exploits analog
operational properties of memory chips to perform massively-parallel
operations in memory, with low-cost changes, 2) processing near
memory, which integrates sophisticated additional processing
capability in memory controllers, the logic layer of 3D-stacked memory
technologies, or memory chips to enable high memory bandwidth and low
memory latency to near-memory logic. We show both types of
architectures can enable orders of magnitude improvements in
performance and energy consumption of many important workloads, such
as graph analytics, database systems, machine learning, video
processing. We discuss how to enable adoption of such fundamentally
more intelligent architectures, which we believe are key to
efficiency, performance, and sustainability. We conclude with some
guiding principles for future computing architecture and system
designs.

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
							The always increasing transistor count in modern chips, as well the exploding number of devices connected to the internet of things, is demanding new design approaches. One fundamental issue and challenge is the design optimization, mainly power optimization. In some applications, as implantable devices, reliability and power optimization is fundamental. It will be done an overview of some techniques for power optimization at different levels of abstraction.  But the main focus will be related to the physical design optimization, as it is becoming an important issue, not only for power optimization, but also for connections and vias optimization, increasing routability as well reliability. It will be shown techniques and examples of optimization at physical design level.

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
				As quantum computing devices continues to scale up, we would like to access the quality of the existing quantum compilation (or design automation) tools. As the first step, we focus on the layout synthesis step.  We develop a novel method to construct a family of quantum circuits with known optimal, QUEKO, which have known optimal depths and gate counts on a given quantum device coupling graph. With QUEKO, we evaluated several leading industry and academic LSQC tools, including Cirq from Google,  Qiskit from IBM, and t|ket> from CQC. We found rather surprisingly large optimality gaps, up to 45x on even near-term feasible circuits. Then, we went on to develop a tool for optimal layout synthesis for quantum computing, named OLSQ, which formulates LSQC as a mathematical optimization problem. OLSQ more compactly represents the solution space than previous optimal solutions and achieved exponential reduction in computational complexity.  Further enhancements to OLSQ can be made for domain-specific quantum applications.  We shall highlight two such applications: quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and chemical simulation.  (Joint work with Bochen Daniel Tan)

				<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">
				The rise of machine learning has already transformed many research areas, and has the potential to transform chip design. While ML has inspired the design of new domain-specific accelerators, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), there exists many opportunities for using ML to target traditional areas of chip design across the entire stack. In this talk, I will discuss how to identify whether ML can be applied for a particular problem, and what strategies might be suitable for building a practical and robust ML-based solution. I will cover several research projects from the ML for Systems team in Google Brain, including our work on using deep reinforcement learning to drive state-of-the-art results in chip floorplanning, and our latest effort in using ML to automatically optimize key ML accelerator design decisions within the hardware-software stack.
